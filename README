Gourd
=====

Gourd is a minimalist graphite dashboard, generating static html pages
from templates and graph definition files. Gourd can be run on an admin
machine, and the resultant html files pushed to your webserver on changes.
Dynamic behaviour such as period selection and graph refreshes are done
by javascript and jquery.
